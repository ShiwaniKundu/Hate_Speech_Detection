# HATE SPEECH DETECTION
Hate speech on digital platforms promotes harm, division, and mental distress. It appears in various forms like text, speech, and videos, often evolving to evade detection. This challenge calls for advanced tools to detect and manage hate speech across formats, aiming to create a safer online space while minimizing false positives and preserving free expression.

# Introduction
The Goal is to build a comprehensive hate speech detection system that effectively identifies harmful content across various formats (text,, videos), promoting a safer online environment while balancing detection accuracy and free expression.
The system will employ a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for text-based hate speech detection, capturing intricate patterns and relationships in the text data.
